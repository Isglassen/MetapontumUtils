## How to contribute

### Issues and suggestions

The first thing you should do is always to submit an issue including the bug or feature you want to be fixed/added.
We have some templates in place for this, so please use them.
If you don't know how to code, then someone else can work on the issue, otherwise, you can work on it yourself. You should however wait until a contributor has said it's a good idea

### Working on code

Start by making a fork of this repository, alternativly, if I know you and you belive I would let you. Please contact me and I could add you as a contributor.
The fork you make will be a clone of this repository, where you can make any changes you want.
After you are done with your changes, submit them through a pull request and add a descriptive title and description.
